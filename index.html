      <p><em>Administrative Assistant at <strong><a href="https://locations.sylvanlearning.com/us/northridge-ca">Sylvan Learning Center Northridge</a></strong></em></p>
      <p>I am currently employed as an Administrative Assistant at Sylan Learning Center located in Northridge. I am also a senior at the University of California Los Angeles, and I am pursing a Bachelor of Arts Degree in Philosophy. With this degree I am interested in becoming a technical writer. The intellectual, communicative, organizational, and research skills that I have gained from learning philosophy has equipped me with the skills to write the explanatory works involved in technical writing. I also have a strong interest in web development and coding. Together with the skills I learned in Philosophy and my working knowledge in coding and web development, I am a valuable candidate for many positions as I am competent in my writing skills along with being well-rounded and diverse with my web development and coding knowledge.</p></td>
